# ProxyAddress
ProxyAddress Ltd is a social enterprise service which enables the use of an alias address to be used for the purposes of connecting those facing homelessness with support, independent of location.

ProxyAddress involves the use of a secure database comprising the address, associated username, current residence (if any), and the history of each user's account. Homeless people can use the ProxyAddress to provide consistent details to suppliers of key support services, thereby retaining or regaining access. Users are able to update their location and details online, via email, or by text message.

Mail sent to a postal address allocated by the ProxyAddress system would be redirected to wherever the person might be staying â€” or even to somewhere that they could visit to collect their post.
